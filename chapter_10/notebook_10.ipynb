        "* **The Perceptron:** A simple ANN architecture based on a Threshold Logic Unit (TLU). We see how it makes predictions and its main limitation (e.g., it cannot solve the XOR problem)[cite: 284, 288].\n",
        "* **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP):** By stacking Perceptrons (adding hidden layers), MLPs can solve complex problems[cite: 289]. We cover the crucial **backpropagation** algorithm used to train them[cite: 289].\n",
        "* **Activation Functions:** We explain the need for non-linear activation functions (like ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh) to allow the network to learn complex patterns[cite: 291, 292].\n",
        "* **Keras Implementation:** We build, train, and evaluate MLPs for both **classification** (using Fashion MNIST) and **regression** (using the California Housing dataset)[cite: 297, 307].\n",
        "* **Keras APIs:** We explore the three main Keras APIs:\n",
        "    1.  **Sequential API:** For simple stacks of layers[cite: 299].\n",
        "    2.  **Functional API:** For building complex network architectures, such as Wide & Deep models with multiple inputs or outputs[cite: 308].\n",
        "    3.  **Subclassing API:** For creating fully dynamic models by subclassing `keras.Model`[cite: 313].\n",
        "* **Model Management:** We cover practical skills like saving/loading models, using callbacks for `ModelCheckpoint` and `EarlyStopping`, and visualizing learning curves with **TensorBoard**[cite: 314, 315, 317].\n",
        "* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finally, we show how to wrap Keras models to use Scikit-Learn's `RandomizedSearchCV` for effective hyperparameter tuning and provide guidelines on choosing the number of layers, neurons, and other key parameters[cite: 320, 323, 324]."

        "\n",
        "1.  **TLU Computation:** The TLU computes a weighted sum of its inputs ($z = \\mathbf{w}^\\top \\cdot \\mathbf{x} + b$) and then applies a **step function** to that sum to produce an output[cite: 284, 285]. For example, it might output 1 if $z$ is positive, and 0 otherwise.\n",
        "2.  **Perceptron Architecture:** A Perceptron is composed of a single layer of TLUs, with each TLU connected to all the inputs (a *fully connected layer*)[cite: 285].\n",
        "3.  **Training (Hebb's Rule):** The Perceptron is trained using a rule inspired by Hebb's rule (\"Cells that fire together, wire together\")[cite: 286]. The Perceptron learning rule reinforces connections that help reduce the error. When an output neuron produces a wrong prediction, it reinforces the connection weights from the inputs that would have contributed to the correct prediction[cite: 286, 287].\n",
        "4.  **Limitations:** In 1969, Minsky and Papert highlighted that Perceptrons are incapable of solving some trivial problems, most famously the **XOR (Exclusive OR) classification problem**[cite: 288]. This is true for any linear classification model."

        "**Backpropagation (Training in a Nutshell):**\n",
        "1.  **Forward Pass:** The algorithm feeds one mini-batch of data to the network. It computes the output of all neurons in each layer and passes the result to the next layer until it gets the final output. All intermediate results are preserved[cite: 290].\n",
        "2.  **Measure Error:** The algorithm measures the network's output error using a loss function[cite: 290].\n",
        "3.  **Backward Pass (Error Gradients):** It computes how much each output connection contributed to the error (using the chain rule). It then continues to measure the error contributions from each connection in the layer below, working backward until it reaches the input layer. This reverse pass efficiently measures the error gradient across all connection weights in the network[cite: 290, 291].\n",
        "4.  **Gradient Descent Step:** Finally, the algorithm performs a Gradient Descent step to tweak all the connection weights and biases using the error gradients it just computed[cite: 291].\n",
        "\n",
        "**Activation Functions:**\n",

        "* **Sigmoid (Logistic):** `σ(z) = 1 / (1 + exp(–z))`. Outputs a number between 0 and 1[cite: 291].\n",
        "* **Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh):** `tanh(z) = 2σ(2z) – 1`. Outputs a number between -1 and 1. This range tends to help speed up convergence[cite: 291].\n",
        "* **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):** `ReLU(z) = max(0, z)`. It is fast to compute and has become the default. It doesn't saturate for positive values, which helps reduce issues during Gradient Descent[cite: 292].\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why are they needed?** If you chain several linear transformations (layers without an activation function), all you get is a single linear transformation. Without nonlinearity between layers, a deep network is equivalent to a single flat layer, which cannot solve complex problems[cite: 292]."

        "While there are many libraries to automate tuning (Hyperopt, Keras Tuner, etc.), it helps to have a good starting point.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Number of Hidden Layers:** For many problems, 1 or 2 hidden layers is enough. For more complex problems, you can ramp up the number of layers until you start overfitting. For very complex tasks, it's better to use **transfer learning** (reusing the lower layers of a pretrained network) than to train a large network from scratch[cite: 323, 324].\n",
        "* **Number of Neurons per Layer:** A common practice used to be a pyramid (fewer neurons at each layer). A more modern approach is to use the **same number of neurons** in all hidden layers, as this is one less hyperparameter to tune[cite: 324, 325]. A good strategy is to pick a model with more layers and neurons than you need (the \"stretch pants\" approach) and then use early stopping and regularization to prevent overfitting[cite: 325].\n",
        "* **Learning Rate:** This is often the most important hyperparameter. A good starting point is often found by increasing the rate exponentially, plotting the loss, and picking a rate slightly lower than where the loss shoots up[cite: 325].\n",
        "* **Optimizer, Batch Size, Activation:** These are also key parameters to tune. ReLU (or its variants, see Ch 11) is a good default for hidden layers. Using early stopping means you don't need to tune the number of iterations[cite: 325, 326]."
