        "## Chapter Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "This chapter covers the crucial final steps in a machine learning project: deploying a trained model into a production environment and scaling up training for large, complex models.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Serving a TensorFlow Model:** We learn how to export a model to TensorFlow's **SavedModel** format, which is a universal, language-neutral format that includes the computation graph and weights. We then deploy this model using **TensorFlow Serving (TF Serving)**, a high-performance, production-ready serving system. We learn how to:\n",
        "    * Install TF Serving using Docker.\n",
        "    * Serve a model and query it using both the **REST API** (simple, JSON-based) and the **gRPC API** (high-performance, binary-based).\n",
        "    * Deploy new model versions seamlessly for graceful transitions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Deploying on the Cloud (GCP AI Platform):** We explore how to use a managed cloud service like **Google Cloud AI Platform** to serve our models. This handles all the infrastructure, scaling, and version management for us. We learn how to set up a project, create a model, and deploy a model version from a SavedModel stored in Google Cloud Storage (GCS).\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Deploying to Other Platforms:** We briefly cover other deployment targets:\n",
        "    * **TensorFlow Lite (TFLite):** For deploying models on **mobile and embedded devices**. This involves converting the model to a lightweight `.tflite` (FlatBuffer) format and using optimizations like **quantization** to reduce model size and latency.\n",
        "    * **TensorFlow.js:** For running models directly in a **web browser**, enabling client-side ML, user privacy, and low latency.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Using GPUs:** We cover how to accelerate training using GPUs. This includes managing GPU memory (e.g., enabling memory growth to avoid grabbing all RAM at once) and how to explicitly place operations on a CPU or GPU using `tf.device()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Distributed Training at Scale:** For very large models or datasets, we explore how to train a model across multiple devices and servers using TensorFlow's **Distribution Strategies API**.\n",
        "    * **Data Parallelism:** The main strategy, where the model is replicated on each device, and each replica processes a different batch of data.\n",
        "    * **`MirroredStrategy`:** For synchronous training on all GPUs on a single machine.\n",
        "    * **`MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`:** For synchronous training across multiple machines (a TF Cluster).\n",
        "    * **`ParameterServerStrategy`:** An asynchronous strategy where parameters are stored on dedicated parameter servers.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  **Hyperparameter Tuning on GCP:** Finally, we learn how to use **GCP AI Platform's hyperparameter tuning service** (based on Google Vizier) to run a black-box Bayesian optimization search to find the best hyperparameters for our model automatically."
