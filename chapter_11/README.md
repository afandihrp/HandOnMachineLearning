# Chapter 11: Training Deep Neural Networks

This notebook serves as a summary and submission for **Chapter 11** of the book *"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow."*

This chapter tackles the primary challenges encountered when training very deep neural networks (e.g., 10+ layers) and provides the modern solutions that make Deep Learning practical.

## 📚 Chapter Summary: Key Problems and Solutions

This notebook explores the main problems in training DNNs and reproduces the code for their solutions.

### 1. The Vanishing/Exploding Gradients Problem
Gradients can become extremely small (vanish) or large (explode) as they are backpropagated through many layers, making it impossible for lower layers to train.

**Solutions Covered:**
* **Initialization:** Using smarter weight initialization, like **Glorot/Xavier** and **He initialization**.
* **Activation Functions:** Using non-saturating functions like **ReLU** and its variants (Leaky ReLU, ELU, PReLU).
* **Batch Normalization:** Adding `BatchNormalization` layers to normalize the inputs to each layer, which stabilizes training and acts as a regularizer.
* **Gradient Clipping:** Clipping the gradients during optimization to prevent them from exploding.

### 2. Slow Training
Training a very large network can be extremely slow.

**Solutions Covered:**
* **Transfer Learning:** Reusing the lower layers of a pretrained network (e.g., one trained on ImageNet) to avoid training a large network from scratch.
* **Faster Optimizers:** Replacing standard Stochastic Gradient Descent with more advanced optimizers like **Momentum**, **Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG)**, **AdaGrad**, **RMSProp**, **Adam**, and **Nadam**.
* **Learning Rate Scheduling:** Using techniques to automatically adjust the learning rate during training, such as power, exponential, piecewise, and performance scheduling.

### 3. Overfitting
With millions of parameters, deep networks are highly prone to overfitting the training data.

**Solutions Covered:**
* **Regularization:** Using $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ regularization.
* **Dropout:** Adding `Dropout` layers, which randomly "turn off" a percentage of neurons during each training step, forcing the network to learn more robust features.
* **Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout:** Using dropout during inference to get multiple predictions and a measure of uncertainty.
* **Max-Norm Regularization:** Constraining the maximum weight value for each neuron.

## 💻 Code & Concepts Reproduced

This notebook provides code examples and theoretical explanations for the following techniques:

* **Initialization:** `keras.layers.Dense(..., kernel_initializer="he_normal")`
* **Activation Functions:** `keras.layers.LeakyReLU(alpha=0.2)`
* **Batch Normalization:** `keras.layers.BatchNormalization()`
* **Gradient Clipping:** `optimizer=keras.optimizers.SGD(clipvalue=1.0)`
* **Transfer Learning:** Reusing layers from a pretrained model and setting `layer.trainable = False` to freeze them.
* **Faster Optimizers:** Implementing `SGD` (with Momentum/Nesterov), `Adagrad`, `RMSprop`, and `Adam`.
* **Learning Rate Scheduling:** Using `decay` in the optimizer, custom `LearningRateScheduler` callbacks, and `ReduceLROnPlateau`.
* **Regularization:** Applying `l2` regularization, `Dropout`, and `max_norm` constraints to layers.
